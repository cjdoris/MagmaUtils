# MagmaUtils

Adds basic functionality missing from [Magma](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma).

## Installation

- Clone this repository.
- Attach the `spec` file.

Note that the package is arranged into sub-packages, each with its own `spec` file, so you can pick and choose what to use by attaching deeper `spec` files instead of the global one, which includes everything. You can even attach individual files.
